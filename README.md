# CSC 736 - Machine Learning 
## Objective
1. In this project, we will utilize knowledge of Linear Regression.  
2. Simultaneously, we will visualize the learning process of Regression.

A linear regressor is able to predict values with given inputs based on provided training
dataset. In this assignment, we are required to develop a program that is able to:  
1. Generate points in the training set.
   i. We will arbitrarily define a line y = wx + b (e.g., y = 2x + 3) as our ground truth line.
   ii.
